Cloud security is one of the main concerns in the cloud computing domain. Sharing personal and sensitive information on a third-party medium poses serious risks of data eavesdropping and data misuse by any person with malicious intent. The traditional methods of secure file transfer and information are superfluous in the scenario of cloud. Extensive research and study is undergoing in this field to make cloud more secure and reliable. Some of the methods that stand out include AES encryption and Diffie Hellman Key Exchange. The latter method is so powerful that it may take millions of years for even the most powerful computers of current times to crack the code and reads the file. Our approach proposes a method that involves encrypting the file using any standard encryption technique and using Diffie Hellman for user authentication. In this way the files can be transferred in a public domain securely without the threat of being used by any unauthorized person.
